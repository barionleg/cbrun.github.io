I am CTO at [Obeo](http://www.obeo.fr/fr/), a french company focused on building tools and technologies enabling users to leverage the power of **modeling** to reason on their problems. 
We are building open-source technologies in the [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) project, step after step getting closer to robust and sustainable model where the technology is free yet evolving and supported.


We started in 2006 with technologies focused **reverse engineering** and **code generation** through the creation of the [Acceleo project](http://www.eclipse.org/acceleo/). Then started to get involved in Eclipse through [EMF Compare](https://www.eclipse.org/emf/compare/) and a couple of other projects. 

Obeo is now one of the 11 Strategic Members of the Eclipse Fundation and [has more active commiters](http://dashboard.eclipse.org/companies.html?release=1y)  in Eclipse than **Red-hat** or **Oracle**.


I was there when Obeo was only 4 peoples in a single room and we are now close to 60 peoples spread out over France and just starting to take over the world.

I'm managing a team of talented developpers, growing a number of products from proof of concepts to operational-ready and adapting the company organization and practices over time.
